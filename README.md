<h1 align="center">RolePlus - Core<br>Addressable Server Suggestions<br>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</h1></align>

RolePlus is the core plugin used by all the Tesla IT Studios SCP:SL servers, and it introduces a lot of modifications.
<br>Almost all the base-game features are suppressed and/or deprecated, in fact, RolePlus overrides all those features' behavior, allowing us to easily implement modifications and make them compatible with the base-game code without having to worry about conflicts.
<br>It consists of multiple modules and is purpose-built to allow us to introduce new features following a valid, orderly and long-term sustainable workflow.

## Modules

**CR-M (CustomRoles-Module)** allows us to add new roles and SCPs, including models and animations.

**CI-M (CustomItems-Module)** allows us to add new items and weapons, including models and animations.

**CG-M (CustomGamemodes-Module)** allows us to add new events and gamemodes relying on base-game and EXILED features.

**EG-M (EndemicGamemodes-Module)** allows us to add new events and gamemodes suppressing all the base-game and EXILED features and their behavior, in order to extend and alter the **RolePlus CG** module's behavior and make it more complex.

**CC-M (CustomControllers-Module)** allows us to handle and override base-game controllers' behavior intended to be used with specific roles and/or items, especially for SCPs.

**ACM-M (AdditionalContentManager-Module)** which is the module that allows us to heavily mod the gameplay, including maps, models and audio clips. ACM handles everything that is not handled by other modules.

## How do suggestions work?
You can make a suggestion about a feature you'd like to see on RolePlus, or also report a bug describing all the steps to reproduce it in the most detailed way as well as the suggestion.
<br>To make the actual suggestion or report a bug, open an issue and wait for it to be reviewed.
<br>Include as much detail as possible, in order to evaluate the suggestion or the bug report and develop a solid workflow to implement the solution.
<br>Including more detail will also affect the priority of the issue, leading to a major probability to escalate the issue directly to the development team, which will implement a solution as soon as possible.

## How do I know if a suggestions has been accepted?
All the suggestions and bug reports will be updated every time we're gonna do modifications related to them.
If we add a new feature, we're gonna link it to the relative issue, and it will be closed when the new version which includes the requested feature or fix is released.

## How can I contribute to the development?
Your suggestions and bug reports will help us to improve RolePlus and all its modules in order to keep adding new features.
<br>The feedback should be always positive, and we'd like to know and assist you if you're experiencing issues during the games.
<br>You can also contribute joining our team if you think you've the experience and the knowledge to understand and improve our work.
